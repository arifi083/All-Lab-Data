How FIB network architecture generally works:
1.	FIB Overview:
o	The Forwarding Information Base (FIB) is a table used by routers to determine packet forwarding.
o	It contains mappings of destination network addresses to the next-hop router or interface.
2.	Populating the FIB:
o	FIB entries are populated through routing protocols such as OSPF, RIP, and BGP.
o	These protocols exchange routing information among routers to build and update the FIB.
3.	Forwarding Decisions:
o	When a router receives an incoming packet, it examines the destination IP address.
o	The router looks up the destination address in its FIB.
o	If a matching entry is found in the FIB, the router forwards the packet based on the next-hop information specified in the FIB entry.
o	If no matching entry is found, the router typically either drops the packet or forwards it to a default route if configured.


Write a Makefile
Install some dependencies:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iproute2 -y
sudo apt install net-tools
sudo apt install iputils-ping -y
sudo apt install vim -y
sudo apt install make -y


Create a file:
vim Makefile

Try this one:
namespaces:
	@ sudo ip netns add red
	@ sudo ip netns add blue
	@ sudo ip netns add router

bridges:
	@ sudo ip link add br-red type bridge
	@ sudo ip link add br-blue type bridge
	@ sudo ip link set dev br-red up
	@ sudo ip link set dev br-blue up

cables:
	@ sudo ip link add v-red type veth peer name v-red-ns
	@ sudo ip link add v-blue type veth peer name v-blue-ns
	@ sudo ip link add vr-red type veth peer name vr-red-ns
	@ sudo ip link add vr-blue type veth peer name vr-blue-ns

interfaces:
	@ sudo ip link set v-red-ns netns red
	@ sudo ip link set v-blue-ns netns blue
	@ sudo ip link set v-red master br-red
	@ sudo ip link set v-blue master br-blue
	@ sudo ip link set vr-red master br-red
	@ sudo ip link set vr-blue master br-blue
	@ sudo ip link set vr-red-ns netns router
	@ sudo ip link set vr-blue-ns netns router

ipaddr:
	@ sudo ip netns exec red ip addr add 10.11.0.2/24 dev v-red-ns
	@ sudo ip netns exec blue ip addr add 10.12.0.3/24 dev v-blue-ns
	@ sudo ip netns exec router ip addr add 10.11.0.1/24 dev vr-red-ns
	@ sudo ip netns exec router ip addr add 10.12.0.1/24 dev vr-blue-ns

state:
	@ sudo ip netns exec red ip link set dev v-red-ns up
	@ sudo ip netns exec blue ip link set dev v-blue-ns up
	@ sudo ip netns exec router ip link set dev vr-red-ns up
	@ sudo ip netns exec router ip link set dev vr-blue-ns up
	@ sudo ip link set dev v-red up
	@ sudo ip link set dev v-blue up
	@ sudo ip link set dev vr-red up
	@ sudo ip link set dev vr-blue up

routes:
	@ sudo ip netns exec red ip route add default via 10.11.0.1
	@ sudo ip netns exec blue ip route add default via 10.12.0.1

ping:
	@ sudo ip netns exec red ping -c 4 10.12.0.3

forwarding:
	@ sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface br-red --jump ACCEPT
	@ sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface br-blue --jump ACCEPT
	@ sudo iptables --append FORWARD --out-interface br-red --jump ACCEPT
	@ sudo iptables --append FORWARD --out-interface br-blue --jump ACCEPT


delete:
	@ sudo ip netns delete red
	@ sudo ip netns delete blue
	@ sudo ip netns delete router
	@ sudo ip link delete br-red type bridge
	@ sudo ip link delete br-blue type bridge



How the FIB works in our environment:

1. Router Configuration:
•	In our setup, the router namespace is acting as a router between the red and blue namespaces.
•	The router's FIB contains information about the next-hop IP addresses for each destination network.
•	When a packet arrives at the router, it consults its FIB to determine the next-hop interface and IP address for the packet.
 Routing Table:
o	The routing table in the router namespace contains the routing information used to populate the FIB.
o	Entries in the routing table specify the destination network (e.g., 10.11.0.0/24 for the red namespace and 10.12.0.0/24 for the blue namespace) and the next-hop IP address for each network.
o	The router uses this routing table to populate its FIB with the necessary forwarding information.

Packet Forwarding:
•	When a packet arrives at the router, it performs a lookup in its FIB to determine the next-hop interface and IP address for the packet's destination.
•	Based on the information in the FIB, the router forwards the packet to the appropriate interface.
•	If the packet's destination is within the same network (e.g., from red to router), the router forwards the packet directly to the destination host without further routing.
