In Linux networking, within the Linux network stack, routes define traffic paths, iptables 
configures packet filtering, lo is a local loopback interface for testing, and eth0 is the primary
Ethernet interface for external connections. Let's inspect the network stack, in short.

Network interfaces allow us to establish communication between a network and a device.

ip link list
lo is the loopback interface, allowing local network communication 
within a device without external network involvement. Verify the loopback interface is up

ifconfig lo
A route in networking specifies the path for network traffic from source to destination. View the routing table:

ip route show
iptables is a user-space utility for configuring packet filter rules in the Linux kernel's Netfilter framework. View iptables rules:

iptables -L
Create Custom Network Namespace
Let's create a custom namespace using ip netns add utiliy.

sudo ip netns add poridhi
sudo ip netns list
Now, entering a network namespace in Linux:

ip netns exec

It is part of the iproute2 package and is often used for managing network namespaces.

sudo ip netns exec poridhi bash
nsenter

The nsenter utility is commonly used to enter into namespaces in Linux, including network namespaces.

sudo nsenter --net=/var/run/netns/poridhi bash
Now, check the network interfaces inside the new ns.

ip link show
Let's check for iptable rules for custom ns.

ifconfig lo
